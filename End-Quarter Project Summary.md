# Fall End of the Quarter Project Summary
## Where is our project now?
The website allows users to login, logout, search decks by filter fields, download decks, upload decks, view card content of each uploaded deck (images included; note: this is a "fix" since the final demo), edit card content of each uploaded deck, and download decks that include edits to cards (a.k.a. rezipping and packaging; note: this is a "fix" since the final demo). 
## What are the main pending tasks we have now?
Major "overhaul" addition will include some sort of features that will make each login session per user more customized to their class year (MS1,2,3, or 4), but the logistics will be discussed starting the beginning of next quarter. Other tasks that will need to be completed are UI and interaction design based on user testing and feedback. 
## What should we do to complete those tasks?
We need to discuss as a team the specifics of how we plan on implementing the above. Also need to speak with sponsor as to how he will get us user testers for next quarter.
